# Cantrips

- **Fire Bolt**
    - VS / 120ft
    - **Damage:** `2d10` fire
    - *You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `1d10` fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn’t being worn or carried. At Higher Levels this spell’s damage increases by `1d10` when you reach 5th level (`2d10`), 11th level (`3d10`), and 17th level (`4d10`).*
- **Mage Hand**
    - VS / 30ft
    - **Duration:** 1 min
    - *A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.*
    - *You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it. The hand can’t attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds.*
- **Prestidigitation**
    - VS / 10ft
    - **Duration:** Up to 1 hour
    - *This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:*
        - *You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor*
        - *You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.*
        - *You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.*
        - *You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.*
        - *You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.*
        - *You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.*
    - *If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.*
- **Minor Illusion**
    - SM / 30ft
    - **Duration:** 1 min
    - *You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.*
        - *If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.*
        - *If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.*
    - *If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.*
- **Message**
    - VSM / 120ft
    - **Duration:** 1 round
    - *You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.*
    - *You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.*
- **Guidance**
- **Sacred Flame**
- **Light**
- **Spare the Dying**
    - VS / 30ft / Bonus
    - **Duration:** Instanteous
    - You touch a living creature that has 0 hit points. The creature becomes stable. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs

# Known spells

All currently known spells

## 1st level

- **Sleep**
    - VSM / 90ft
    - **Duration:** 1 min
    - *This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll `5d8`, the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).*
    - *Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t affected by this spell.*
    - *At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional `2d8` for each slot level above 1st.*
- **Feather Fall**
    - VM / 60ft / Reaction
    - **Duration:** 1 min
    - *Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature’s rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If the creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the spell ends for that creature.*
- **Mage Armor**
    - VSM / Touch
    - **Duration:** 8 hours
    - *You touch a willing creature who isn’t wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target’s base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.*
- **Shield**
    - VS / Self / Reaction
    - **Duration:** 1 round
    - *An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from magic missile.*
- **Detect Magic** *(Ritual)*
    - VS / Self 
    - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 min
    - *For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.*
    - *The spell can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.*
- **Magic Missile**
    - VS / 120ft
    - **Damage:** `3 x (1d4 + 1)` force
    - *You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals `1d4 + 1` force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.*
    - ***At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.*
- **Comprehend Languages** *(Ritual)*
    - VSM / Self
    - **Duration:** 1 hour
    - *For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text. This spell doesn’t decode secret messages in a text or glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn’t part of a written language.*
- **Catapult**
    - S / 150ft
    - **Damage:** `3d8` bludgeoning
    - *Choose one object weighing 1 to 5 pounds within range (60ft) that isn’t being worn or carried. The object flies in a straight line up to 90 feet in a direction you choose before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts against a solid surface. If the object would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the object strikes the target and stops moving. When the object strikes something, the object and what it strikes each take `3d8` bludgeoning damage.*
    - *At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the maximum weight of objects that you can target with this spell increases by 5 pounds, and the damage increases by `1d8`, for each slot level above 1st.*
- **Find Familiar** *(Ritual)*
    - VSM* / 10ft / 1 hour
    - *You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.*
    - *Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.*
    - *When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 hit points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.*
    - *While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.*
    - *You can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.*
    - *Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.*

- **False Life**
    - VSM* / Self / 1 hour
    - *Bolstering yourself with a necromantic facsimile of life, you gain 1d4+4 temporary hit points for the duration.*
    - *At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you gain 5 additional temporary hit points for each slot level above 1st*
- **Bane**
- **Cure Wounds**
- **Bless**
- **Guiding Bolt**


## 2nd level

- **Suggestion**
    - VMC / 30ft
    - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours
    - *You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.*
    - *The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it purses the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.*
    - *You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn’t met before the spell expires, the activity isn’t preformed.*
    - *If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.*
- **Misty Step**
    - V / 30ft / Bonus
    - *Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.*
- **Detect Thoughts**
    - VSMC / 30ft
    - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
    - *For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.*
    - *You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.*
    - *Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.*
    - *You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.*
    - *Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.*
- **Levitate**
    - VSMC / 60ft
    - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
    - *One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.*
    - *The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target’s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell’s range.*
    - *When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.*
- **Invisibility**
- **Mirror Image**


## 3rd level

- **Fireball**
    - VSM / 150ft
    - **Damage:** `8d6` fire
    - *A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes `8d6` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.*
    - *At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.*
- **Leomund's Tiny Hut** *(Ritual)*
    - VSM / Self (10 ft radius) / 1 min
    - **Duration:** 8 hours
    - *A 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you leave its area.*
    - *Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can't extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.*
    - *Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.*
- **Counterspell**
- **Sending**
- **Dispel Magic**
- **Major Image**
- **Fly**
- **Lightning Bolt**
- **Remove Curse**
