# Race: Elf (Haltia)

> Source: Player's Handbook

*Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.*

*Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.*

- **Ability Score Increase:** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.
- **Age:** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.
- **Size:** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.
- **Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
- **Darkvision:** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
- **Keen Senses:** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.
- **Fey Ancestry:** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
- **Trance:** Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for ~~4~~ 8 *(in this campaign)* hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
- **Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.

<br/>

## Subrace: High-Elf (Suurhaltia)

> Source: Player's Handbook

*As a high elf, you have a Keen Mind and a mastery of at least The Basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more Common and more friendly, and often encountered among Humans and Other Races.*

- **Ability Score Increase:** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.
- **Elf Weapon Training⁠:** You have Proficiency with the Longsword, Shortsword, Shortbow, and Longbow.
- **Cantrip:** You know one cantrip of your choice from the Wizard spell list. Intelligence is your Spellcasting ability for it.
- **Extra Language⁠:** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.

# Class: Wizard

*Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, brute-force mind control, and much more.*

*You must have an Intelligence score of 13 or higher in order to multiclass in or out of this class.*

- (a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger
- (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
- (a) a scholar's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
- A spellbook

### Spellcasting

As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.

**Cantrips**

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.

**Spellbook**

At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.

The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.

Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.

Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.

Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.

If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.

The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.

**Preparing and Casting Spells**

The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

**Spellcasting Ability**

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Ritual Casting**

You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.

**Spellcasting Focus**

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

**Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher**

Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook.

### Arcane Recovery

You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

### Level 2 - Arcane Tradition

When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Level 4 - Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Level 18 - Spell Mastery

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.

### Level 20 - Signature Spells

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

## School of Divination

> Source: Player's Handbook

*The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and commoners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.*


## Level 2 - Divination Savant

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a Divination spell into your spellbook is halved.


## Level 2 - Portent

Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.

Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.


## Level 6 - Expert Divination

Beginning at 6th level, casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and can't be higher than 5th level.


## Level 10 - The Third Eye

Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to increase your powers of perception. When you do so, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you are incapacitated or you take a short or long rest. You can't use the feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

- **Darkvision:** You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
- **Ethereal Sight:** You can see into the Ethereal Plane within 60 feet of you.
- **Greater Comprehension:** You can read any language.
- **See Invisibility:** You can see invisible creatures and objects within 10 feet of you that are within line of sight.


## Level 14 - Greater Portent

Starting at 14th level, the visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Portent feature, rather than two.

# Backstory

Halusi nuorena ryhtyä munkiksi ja pääsikin lähiluostariin koeajalle. Koeajalla kuitenkin kyllästyi munkkeuden ideaan, kun löysi luostarin kirjastosta kirjan taikuudesta. Innostui aiheesta ja uppoutui lukemaan kirjaa niin, että käveli vahingossa lähikylään nenä kirjassa munkkivaatteet päällään. Kun Aatos vihdoin havahtui kirjan uumenista, hän päätti olla palaamatta luostariin ja lähti oppimaan lisää taikuudesta. Munkinkaavut ja kirjan voisi palautta sitten joskus myöhemmin takaisin luostariin, sillä tämä on tärkeämpää.

Elämä ja opinnot veivät mennessään ja tavarat jäivät palauttamatta takaisin luostariin. Munkin vaattet edelleen käytössä (vaikka ne kulahtaneet jo jonkin verran) ja lainattu taikuuskirja kulkee edelleen mukana muistoesineenä. Tuskin kukaan kuitenkaan kirjaa tai kaapuja luostarissa kaivannut... Aatos edelleen opiskelee taikuutta innolla ja elää pääosin varsin askeettisesti. Saattaa joskus esittää munkkia, jos ei halua että palastuu heti velhoksi.

Pelin alussa Aatos kulkee kohti Satorin valtakuntaa tavoitteenaan tutustua paikallisin yliopistoihin ja taikuuskirjallisuuteen
